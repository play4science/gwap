gwap: Open platform for Games with a purpose
============================================

"Games with a purpose" aim at engaging a broad mass of users in a game in order to solve problems that so far cannot be solved by computers alone.

gwap is a JBoss Seam server application that facilitates the creation of such games.

Examples
--------
The source code for the following platforms are included:

- [ARTigo.org](http://www.artigo.org) - games for social image tagging for artworks

- [Termina](http://termina.pms.ifi.lmu.de) - a game for learning concepts and associated terms
